Publishing a photography book is a rewarding way to preserve your creative work and share it with people who appreciate it. This guide outlines my personal process for creating “2025 Be Seen”, a private photo book project for friends.

## Define the Concept and Audience
Before anything else, clarify what your book represents and who it’s for. For this project, the goal is simple: to document and share the photography I create throughout 2025. It’s not meant for commercial release, but rather as a personal collection — a small publication for friends.

## Plan the Content
Gather your best work from the year and think about how it connects as a series.  
- Select photos that tell a visual story or capture a mood  
- Keep consistent themes and tone  
- Consider short captions or small text pieces if they enhance the flow  
Organize everything early, so the design process stays smooth later.

## Design and Layout
InDesign is the main tool for layout. If you already use Photoshop or Lightroom, learning InDesign won’t take long. I also use Lightroom for color correction and consistency before importing images into InDesign.

### Print Setup
When preparing your file for print, remember:
- Color mode: CMYK  
- Resolution: 300 dpi  
- Bleed: 3 mm  
- Output: PDF (print quality)  
- Always make a test print before full production

### Format and Style
- Size: A5, 100 pages  
- Typography: clean and balanced font that fits the tone of the work  
- Layout: based on grid systems for structure and flow  

For the cover, explore design inspiration from other photographers’ books and design archives. The cover should feel connected to the content, not just decorative.

## Print and Assembly

Once the layout is ready, find a printing shop you trust. I used one found through Taobao, which offered good custom options and quality control.

Paper choice depends on the mood of your photos:
- Matte for a soft, muted look  
- Semi-gloss for more contrast  
- Textured for a tactile, artistic feel  

Common binding methods include:
- Stapled for short zine-style projects  
- Thread-sewn for a durable, traditional finish  
- Perfect binding for a clean, professional book look  

## Finally

Creating a photography book is as much about editing and curation as it is about printing. Take your time to refine the story, test print layouts, and enjoy the process. When you hold the finished book in your hands, it’s more than paper — it’s a record of your year and your way of seeing the world.
