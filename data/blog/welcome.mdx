# Welcome to My Blog

This is where I share my journey, thoughts, and creative work. I believe that by documenting and sharing these experiences, I can grow as a person and hopefully provide value to others along the way.

## What You'll Find Here

I write about a variety of topics that interest me:

- **Web Development**: Technical articles about modern web technologies, frameworks, and best practices
- **Photography**: Visual stories and insights from my photography work
- **Personal Reflections**: Thoughts on life, creativity, and continuous learning

## Why I Started This Blog

The name "Sleeping Fish" comes from those quiet moments of reflection - like a fish resting beneath the surface, observing the world above. This blog is my space to surface those observations and share them with you.

## Stay Connected

I hope you find something here that resonates with you. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect.

Thank you for visiting!
