This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What You Can Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Technology**: My experiences with web development, programming, and new technologies
- **Photography**: Tips, techniques, and stories behind my photos

### Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write in Markdown with MDX components
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all devices
